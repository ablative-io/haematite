//// Stage prompt projection functions (P2): every stage prompt is a pure,
//// budgeted function of the brief document, the pre-resolved reference
//// context, and the explicit stage inputs it is handed — no filesystem
//// access, no ambient state, no engine imports. Projections are
//// unit-tested like codecs against the checklist budgets (scout 6000,
//// dev 9000, review 12000 characters).
////
//// Rendering discipline (PROMPTING.md):
//// - anchored decisions render as `id: title — decision` lines; when an
////   ADR carries a quote, the speaker's quoted words follow verbatim,
////   never paraphrased (P6);
//// - requirements inline their resolved C#/S# texts; the full checklist
////   and stories documents are never forwarded;
//// - every stage sees the brief's boundaries verbatim and the design file
////   as a path reference; design prose beyond the context's intention and
////   constraint lines never rides a prompt.
////
//// No ledger text lives in this module: quotes and decision texts flow
//// from `ResolvedContext` values at call time.
