//! Typed shell-out boundary, mirroring `../src/stacked_dev/cli.gleam` and the

//! Every command outcome is typed: a missing executable is loud, structured
//! data (never a silent skip), and a non-zero exit status is recorded data
//! the caller interprets (diagnostics for check runners, a forfeited cache
//! for the warm build). Output is the combined stdout/stderr text — the port
//! runner merges the streams (`stderr_to_stdout`); here both are captured and
//! concatenated (stdout first), which is identical whenever one stream is
//! silent.
