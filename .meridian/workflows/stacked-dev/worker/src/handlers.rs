//! Activity handler bodies, mirroring `../src/stacked_dev/locals.gleam`
//! invocation for invocation.
//!
//! Each handler shells to the real CLI that owns the step (`yg` for worktree
//! provisioning, affected-module scoping, and diagnostics checks, `norn` for
//! the dev agent, `cargo` for the advisory warm build, `meridian` for review
//! requests and landing) through [`crate::shell::Shell`]. Failure
//! classification follows the local implementations: a CLI that cannot run
//! (missing executable, dead working directory) and a command the contract
//! requires to exit zero are **terminal** activity failures — retrying a
//! broken environment cannot help. A non-zero exit that the contract treats
//! as recorded data (a forfeited warm cache, check diagnostics, a gate
//! report) is a successful activity result, never an error.
//!
//! The functions are plain synchronous `(Shell, Input) -> Result<Output, _>`
//! so the hermetic tests drive them directly with fake-CLI shims on a
//! private `PATH`; `main.rs` adapts them onto the worker's async handler
//! signature.
